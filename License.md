# VMware® Workspace ONE® Software Development Kit License Agreement

**VMware, Inc. (“VMware”) provides the VMware Software Development Kit (collectively the “Software”) to
you subject to the following terms and conditions. By downloading, installing, or using the Software, you (the
individual or legal entity) agree to be bound by the terms of this license agreement (the “Agreement”). If you
disagree with any of the following terms, then do not use the Software.**

**1. VMware Products:** The Software contains a variety of materials, interface definitions, documentation, sample
    utility applications and sample code regarding programming interfaces to VMware’s Workspace ONE UEM
    offering (the **“Workspace ONE Product** ”). This Software is intended to be used to develop software
    that interacts with the Workspace ONE Products.

**2. Use Rights:** Subject to the restrictions below, you may download and make a reasonable number of copies of
    the Software for your use solely for the purpose of creating software that communicates with the Workspace
    ONE Product (the “ **Developer Software** ”). Some code may be designated as “distributable code” and/or
    “modifiable code” at [http://www.vmware.com/go/vwssdk-redistribution-info.](http://www.vmware.com/go/vwssdk-redistribution-info.) You may use and merge all or
    portions of the “distributable code” with your Developer Software. Any merged portion of any “distributable
    code” is subject to this Agreement. Additionally, you may modify or create derivative works of all or portions
    of the “modifiable code.” You are permitted to re-distribute the “distributable code” and the modified or
    derivative works of the “modifiable code” only as part of your Developer Software for non-commercial or
    commercial use; provided that you shall only distribute such code subject to a license agreement that protects
    VMware’s and its licensors’ interests consistent with the terms contained in this Agreement. If VMware has a
    certification program that is related to certain code, then VMware may permit you to use, reproduce, modify,
    and distribute the code solely as embedded in your product that complies with the technical limitations and the
    certification requirements set forth in the documentation (the “ **Certification Requirements** ”). Open source
    software components provided with the Software are licensed to you under the terms of the applicable license
    agreements included with such open source software components. The open source software licenses can be
    found in the open_source_licenses.txt file, other materials accompanying the Software, the documentation or
    corresponding source files available at [http://www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html.](http://www.vmware.com/download/open_source.html.)

**3. Restrictions:** You agree that you will not (1) use the Software to create, design or develop anything other than
    Developer Software; (2) make any more copies of the Software than are reasonably necessary for the authorized
    use and backup and archival purposes; (3) modify, create derivative works of, reverse engineer, reverse compile,
    or disassemble the Software except as expressly permitted in Section 2; (4) distribute, sell, lease, rent, lend, or
    sublicense any part of the Software to any third party except as expressly permitted in Section 2; or (5) use the
    Software in any manner to (a) circumvent any technical restrictions of the Workspace ONE Product or violate
    any additional licensing terms applicable to the Workspace ONE Product that VMware provides through
    product documentation, email notification on the VMware website or in the Terms of Service or the End User
    License Agreements for the Workspace ONE Product or (b) upload or otherwise transmit any material
    containing software viruses or other computer code, files or programs designed to interrupt, destroy, or limit
    the functionality of any software or hardware.
    The restrictions in this Section 3 shall not apply if and to the extent they contradict mandatory local law
    (including, but not limited to, law implementing the EC Software Directive).

**4. Ownership:** VMware retains ownership of the Software and all intellectual property rights embodied in the
    Software, including without limitation all copyrights, trade secrets and patents. You may not remove, delete or
    modify any of VMware copyright statements in the Software. ALL RIGHTS NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED
    HEREUNDER ARE RESERVED TO VMWARE.

**5. Trademarks:** You may not use VMware’s name, trademarks or service marks in connection with your
    Developer Software in a way that suggests your Developer Software is certified or endorsed by VMware.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, for certain code, and subject to your compliance with the terms of this
    Agreement, VMware grants you a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-assignable, non-
    transferable right and license to display the VMware and Workspace ONE name, trademarks or service marks
    solely in connection with marketing of your Developer Software that meet the Certification Requirements in
    accordance with this Agreement and VMware’s branding guidelines (available upon request). You agree and
    acknowledge that (i) the VMware name, trademarks or service marks, whether or not registered, are the sole
    property of VMware and its subsidiaries; (ii) Your reproduction of the VMware’s name, trademarks or service
    marks inures to the benefit of VMware and its subsidiaries; and (iii) You acquire no legal rights in VMware’s
    name, trademarks or service marks. You agree that you will not adopt or use any name, trademarks or service
    marks or any word, or design that is similar to or confusing with VMware’s name, trademarks or service marks.
    You agree not to use VMware’s name, trademarks or service marks in connection with any activity that (a)
    disparages VMware or its products or services; (b) violates or infringes any intellectual property of VMware;
    or (c) violates any local, state, federal, country, or international regulation or law.

**6. Feedback:** You may from time to time provide suggestion, comments and feedback to VMware concerning the
    functionality and performance of the Software or the Workspace ONE Product including, without limitation,
    identifying potential errors and improvements (collectively the “ **Feedback** ”). Feedback which is provided by
    you to VMware in connection with this Agreement may be freely used by VMware to improve or enhance its
    products and, accordingly, you grant VMware a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, worldwide
    right and license to use, reproduce, disclose, sublicense, modify, make, have made, distribute, sell, offer for
    sale, display, perform, create derivative works, permit unmodified binary distribution and otherwise exploit
    such Feedback without restriction.

**7. Support:** You are not entitled under this Agreement to receive any VMware support or subscription services
    for the Software or any other services from VMware in connection with the Software. If you have purchased
    support and/or subscription services for a VMware product, such support and/or subscription services shall not
    apply to the Software or your use of the Software.

**8. Term, Termination and Changes:** This Agreement shall continue as long as you are in compliance with the
    terms specified herein or until otherwise terminated. You or VMware each may terminate this Agreement for
    any reason at any time. You agree, upon termination, to destroy all copies of the Software within your
    possession or control. The Restrictions, Confidential Information, Limitations of Warranties and Liability,
    Ownership, Feedback, Indemnification, Data Privacy, and General sections set out in this Agreement shall
    survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement.

**9. Confidential Information:** “ **Confidential Information** ” means any information disclosed by VMware to you
    pursuant to this Agreement that is marked “Confidential,” “Proprietary,” or in some similar manner and any
    information which you knew or reasonably should have known to be confidential. You shall treat as confidential
    all Confidential Information of VMware and shall not use such Confidential Information except to exercise
    your rights or perform your obligations under this Agreement. You will protect Confidential Information from
    unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as you protect your own confidential or proprietary
    information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care. You shall not disclose such Confidential
    Information to any third party during or after the term of this Agreement. This paragraph will not apply to any
    Confidential Information that: (a) was rightfully in your possession prior to receipt of such Confidential
    Information from VMware; (b) is or becomes a matter of public knowledge through no fault of you; (c) is
    rightfully received from a third party without a duty of confidentiality; (d) is independently developed by you
    without breach of any confidentiality obligations; (e) is disclosed by you with VMware’s prior written approval;
    or (f) you are required to disclose by applicable law or court order, provided that you notify VMware of such
    required disclosure promptly in writing and cooperate with VMware in any lawful action to contest or limit the
    scope of such required disclosure. You acknowledge that breach of this Section 9 will cause irreparable damage
    to VMware for which monetary damages will be an inadequate remedy. Accordingly, VMware will be entitled
    to seek and obtain injunctive and any other relief (legal or equitable) to restrain any breach or anticipated breach of this Section 9.

**10. Limitations of Warranties and Liability:** THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS” WITHOUT ANY
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND. TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
    VMWARE DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND
    NON-INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
    TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL VMWARE
    BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, LOSS OF USE, BUSINESS
    INTERRUPTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSE-
    QUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE SOFTWARE OR YOUR USE OF THE SOFTWARE,
    UNDER ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE,
    PRODUCT LIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
    EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES,
    THE PRECEDING LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    VMWARE’S LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT AND THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED
    HEREUNDER WILL NOT, IN ANY EVENT, EXCEED US$100.00.
    THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER VMWARE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
    POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY REMEDY FAILS OF ITS
    ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.

**11. Indemnification:** You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless VMware, and any of its directors, officers,
    employees, affiliates and agents, from and against any and all claims, losses, damages, liabilities and other
    expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), arising from your modification of the “modifiable code,” the
    distribution or use of your Developer Software by you or anyone else, and your breach of this Agreement.

**12. Export Control:** You acknowledge that the Software is of United States origin, is provided subject to the U.S.
    Export Administration Regulations, may be subject to the export control laws of the applicable territory, and
    that diversion contrary to applicable export control laws is prohibited. You represent, warrant and covenant that
    (1) you are not, and are not acting on behalf of, (a) any person who is a citizen, national, or resident of, or who
    is controlled by the government of any country to which the United States has prohibited export transactions;
    or (b) any person or entity listed on the U.S. Treasury Department list of Specially Designated Nationals and
    Blocked Persons, or the U.S. Commerce Department Denied Persons List or Entity List; and (2) you will not
    permit the Software to be used for any purposes prohibited by law, including, any prohibited development,
    design, manufacture or production of missiles or nuclear, chemical or biological weapons.

**13. Data Privacy:**
    13.1 Information Collected by VMware about Your Use of the Software. You agree that VMware may
    periodically collect, process and store technical and related information about your device, system,
    application, peripherals and your use of the Software, including without limitation: internet protocol
    address, hardware identification, operating system, application software, peripheral hardware, number of
    active plugins and software development kits, the successful installation and launch of Software,
    and Software usage statistics (collectively, “ Technical Data ”). VMware will use Technical Data for
    internal statistical and analytical purposes to facilitate support, invoicing or online services, the
    provisioning of updates, and the development of VMware products and services. VMware may transfer
    Technical Data to other companies in the VMware worldwide group of companies or third-party service
    providers from time to time.
    You acknowledge that correspondence and log files generated in conjunction with a request for support
    services may contain sensitive, confidential or personal information. You are solely responsible for taking
    the steps necessary to protect such data, including obfuscating the logs or otherwise guarding such
    information prior to sending it to VMware.
    13.2 Information Collected by VMware about End Users of the Developer Software. The purpose of using
    the Software to develop Developer Software is to send end user data, including but not limited to login
    credentials, unique identifiers, device information (model, OS version, application version, jailbreak
    and/or root status, etc.) (the “ Developer Software Data ”) to the Workspace ONE Product. Thus, you
    agree that VMware may collect, process and/or store Developer Software Data from the end users of the
    Developer Software. The specific Developer Software Data processed depends on how You configure
    the Developer Software. Please consult the documentation for more information. VMware will process
    the Developer Software Data to (a) facilitate delivery of the Workspace ONE Product (such as (i) tracking
    entitlements, (ii) providing support, (iii) monitoring the performance, integrity, and stability of the
    Workspace ONE Product’s infrastructure, and (iv) preventing or addressing service or technical issues);
    and (b) to improve our products and services, and your experience. You are responsible for complying
    with all applicable privacy laws in your use of the Software and your end user’s use of the Developer
    Software. You are responsible for notifying your end users that the Developer Software Data is processed
    by VMware and providing them with a link to the VMware Privacy
    Notice: http://www.vmware.com/help/privacy.

**14. General:** These terms are governed by the laws of the State of California and the United States of America
    without regard to conflict of laws principles. The United Nations Convention for the International Sale of Goods
    shall not apply. You may not assign this Agreement. Any attempted assignment by you shall be void. These
    terms constitute the entire agreement between you and VMware with respect to the Software and supersede all
    prior written or oral communications, understandings and agreements. Any waiver of these terms must be in
    writing and signed by the waiving party to be effective. If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid or
    unenforceable, the remaining terms will continue to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by
    law.
